# SOAR Implementation & Distributed SIEM Lab

This repository documents the next phase of my journey in building a Security Operations Center (SOC) Lab, focused on the transition from threat detection (SIEM/XDR) to **automated incident response (SOAR)**. This project upgrades the core Wazuh/ELK environment to include dedicated orchestration and case management platforms.

---

## üß† Project Abstract: From Alert to Action

The project is structured to demonstrate the complete incident response lifecycle, proving the ability to reduce **Mean Time to Respond (MTTR)** through codified, automated workflows.

### Key Focus Areas:
* **Orchestration:** Connecting disparate tools (SIEM, Threat Intel, Case Management) into unified workflows.
* **Automation:** Implementing **Human-in-the-Loop** playbooks for consistent and rapid response.
* **Distributed Architecture:** Maintaining system stability and efficiency by distributing heavy services across multiple nodes.

## üß© Project Structure

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **`PHASE_1_FOUNDATION/`** | **Initial Setup & Architecture:** VM/Pi configuration, network base, VNC/SSH access, and resource optimization. |
| **`PHASE_2_SIEM_TUNING/`** | **Detection Logic:** Custom Wazuh rules, decoders, and EDR configuration (FIM, Vulnerability Detection). |
| **`PHASE_3_SOAR_INTEGRATION/`** | **Automation & Orchestration:** Setup of TheHive/Cortex and Shuffle playbooks for response. |
| **`INCIDENT_CASES/`** | **Analyst Work:** Documented attack simulations, forensic findings, and SOAR outcome reports. |
| **`TROUBLESHOOTING/`** | Common problems encountered and solutions (e.g., Elasticsearch JVM tuning, Static IP errors). |

## üß™ Lab Setup: Distributed Architecture

The environment is designed to simulate a production network with separated roles, utilizing a **Virtual Machine (VM)** for processing power and the **Raspberry Pi 4** as the monitored host.

### üíª Machines Used

| Role | OS | Description |
|------|----|-------------|
| **SOC Manager** | Ubuntu 24.04 | **VM (6GB+ RAM)** hosting the Wazuh Manager, ELK Stack, TheHive, and Shuffle. |
| **Monitored Endpoint** | Raspberry Pi OS | **Raspberry Pi 4 (2GB RAM)** running the **Wazuh Agent**. |
| **Attacker** | Kali Linux | **VM** used to launch simulated network and host-based attacks against the Monitored Endpoint. |
